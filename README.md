# Tiny Hot Corners for Windows 10

In GNOME 3 whenever you move the mouse to the top left corner, GNOME switches to the activities view, it looks like this:

 ![Gnome Activities](https://www.gnome.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/window-selection-3.20-420x236.png)

Whenever I'm using Windows 10, I always forget that this doesn't work. Bleh.

I searched around for existing solutions, and wasn't happy with anything I could find.

The options seem to be

 * Some ridiculous AutoHotKey/AutoIT monstrosity (?!?).
 * Massive Delphi application with 100MB of resources.
 * Some naive program that polls GetCursorPos() in a busy loop.

None of these are what I want, I just want that GNOME 3 thing with absolute minimal overhead.

This is a **very** minimal hotcorner app, written in C. It's designed to be hackable, so you can adjust parameters, delays, bindings easily and recompile.

Zero state is stored anywhere, no registry keys or configuration files.

- If you want to configure something, edit the code and recompile.
- If you want to uninstall it, just delete it.

## Instructions

Change any of the parameters, compile, then install.

A binary is available [here](https://github.com/taviso/hotcorner/releases) if you prefer.

### Building on Windows

` > nmake`

### Building on Linux with MinGW-w64 toolchain

` > x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -O2 hotcorner.c -o hotcorner.exe -Wl,-subsystem,windows`

### Installing

`> copy hotcorner.exe "%USERPROFILE%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"`

(or `nmake install`)

### Uninstalling

 `> del "%USERPROFILE%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\hotcorner.exe"`

(or `nmake uninstall`)

If you don't have cl or nmake, they come with Visual Studio (or the Windows SDK, I think).

### Configuration

All configuration requires modifying the parameters in `hotcorner.c` and recompiling.

* `RECT kHotcorner` - The co-ordinates of the hot zone.
* `INPUT kCornerInput[]` - Input sent on activation.
* `MODSTATE kHotKeyModifier[]` - Modifier Keys (shift, alt, ctrl, etc) you want to enable the hotkey function.
* `FAPROC HotKeyCallbacks[]` - List of all the hotkey functions, you can change the indexes or comment them out.
* `DWORD kHotDelay` - How long the pointer must wait in the corner before being activated.

## FAQ

* Q: I don't want to compile it, can't you just give me an exe? :(
* A: Checkout the releases, [here](https://github.com/taviso/hotcorner/releases).


* Q: Can you change a setting, and then compile it for me?
* A: No.


* Q: This doesn't work with my Application/Configuration/Whatever!
* A: File an issue, if it's feasible to workaround I'll try.


* Q: How do I turn it off without rebooting?
* A: You can use LCTRL+LALT+C to completely shut down the application or CTRL+LALT+A to toggle.

* Q: Why doesn't it work if my current program is running as an Administrator?
* A: [UIPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Interface_Privilege_Isolation). I suppose you could "Run As Administrator" if it bothers you.

* Q: I don't want any hotkeys at all!
* Q: Comment out all entries of the `kHotKeyCallbacks[]` array.
